"""/library is served by React, and library.js itself is now deleted.

The vanilla Library list went first; the manage layer and the Watch All modal
followed in the enhanced-view port, and the file's last residents moved to
library-globals.js. What survives the handoff and is not visible from either
side alone: the ids the React page inherited (the guided tour anchors to
them), and the ss:library-changed seam — dispatch and listener both live in
React now, pinned here so a rename on either side fails loudly.
