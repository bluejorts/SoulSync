"""Automations visual redesign — contract safety net (Boulder's overnight).

The redesign is a pure reskin: a stylesheet loaded after style.css/mobile.css
that restyles ONLY existing markup. These tests hold the three promises that
make it functionally risk-free:

1. It's actually loaded (index.html links it after mobile.css).
2. Every class it styles exists in the real markup sources — a typo'd
   selector silently no-ops, which would ship an unstyled element.
3. Every rule is scoped to automations surfaces — nothing can leak into
   other pages that happen to share generic class names (.config-row,
   .toggle-slider live elsewhere too).

Plus a structural parse: balanced braces, non-empty rules.
