#  - rootless Docker/Podman where in-container root maps to a host UID
#    that can't write to a bind-mounted path (mkdir EACCES)
#  - read-only mounts or NFS with squashed root (chown EPERM)
# Pre-mid-2026 the chown line had `|| true` but mkdir didn't — combined
# with `set -e`, a permission-denied mkdir crashed the container into a
# restart loop. Both lines are now best-effort.

# download writes). Better to log now than to debug missing files later.
